## What is it? 

This code adds new options for diffeomorphic registration to the [FAIR](https://github.com/C4IR/FAIR.m) toolbox. The mathematical framework used here is based on the [Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_deformation_diffeomorphic_metric_mapping#Hamiltonian_LDDMM_for_Dense_Image_Matching) approach. What sets  our approach apart is the numerical realization (using a Lagrangian PDE solver to eliminate the constraint) and the flexibility (we support both intensity- and mass-preserving registration).
