# VAMPIRE.m
VAMPIRE stands for Variational Algorithm for Mass-Preserving Image REgistration and is an add-on to the FAIR toolbox; see https://github.com/C4IR/FAIR.m for details and license issues and VAMPIRE/contents.m for overview and advice on VAMPIRE.

## What is it? 
VAMPIRE is a smart implementation of a mass-preserving registration scheme and thus adequate in situations where the overall integral of image intensities needs to be preserved in the registration. VAMPIRE has been used for motion correction in cardiac Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and other applications.

The mathematics and the algorithm are described in
